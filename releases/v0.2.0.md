k6x `v0.2.0` is here ðŸŽ‰!

The most important new feature in this release is the use of the installed go compiler if available. This significantly reduces the time required to create the custom k6 binary, especially from the second build onwards.

In addition, some minor fixes and modifications have been added thanks to [@bandorko](https://github.com/bandorko):
- [#1](https://github.com/szkiba/k6x/pull/1) feat: reverse spinner
- [#2](https://github.com/szkiba/k6x/pull/2) fix: missing deps resolve error output
- [#3](https://github.com/szkiba/k6x/pull/3) fix: cursor disappeared in terminal after interrupt
