# k6x

**Run k6 with extensions as easy as possible**

k6x is a [k6](https://k6.io) launcher that automatically provides k6 with the [extensions](https://k6.io/docs/extensions/) used by the test.  To do this, k6x analyzes the test script and creates a list of required extensions (it also parses the command line to detect output extensions). Based on this list, k6x builds (and caches) the k6 binary and runs it.

The build step uses a [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) (even a [remote one](#remote-docker)), so no other local tools (go, git, docker cli, etc.) are needed, just k6x. If [Go language toolkit is installed](https://go.dev/doc/install), the build step uses it instead of Docker Engine. In this case, Docker Engine is not needed and build will be faster.

## Prerequisites

- Either a [Go language toolkit](https://go.dev/doc/install) or a properly configured [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) environment (e.g. `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable)

## Usage

The `k6x` command is a drop-in replacement for the `k6` command, using exactly the same syntax. For example, running the test script (with `top` output extension):

```bash
k6x run -o top script.js
```

Display the current version of k6 and included extensions:

```
k6x version
```

> **Note**
> Since the syntax of `k6x` is exactly the same as `k6`, it is convenient to place `k6x` as `k6` in the command search path (PATH environment variable) or to create an alias for it as `k6`. Thus, when using the usual `k6` commands, the custom k6 build will happen automatically if a test script needs it.

## Install

Precompiled binaries can be downloaded and installed from the [Releases](https://github.com/szkiba/k6x/releases) page.

If you have a go development environment, the installation can also be done with the following command:

```bash
go install github.com/szkiba/k6x@latest
```

## Docker

k6x is also available as a docker image on Docker Hub under the name [szkiba/k6x](https://hub.docker.com/r/szkiba/k6x).

This docker image can be used as a replacement for the official k6 docker image to run test scripts that use extensions. The basic use of the image is the same as using the official k6 image.

The image automatically provides  [k6](https://k6.io) with the [extensions](https://k6.io/docs/extensions/) used by the tests. To do this, [k6x](https://github.com/szkiba/k6x) analyzes the test script and creates a list of required extensions (it also parses the command line to detect output extensions). Based on this list, k6x builds (and caches) the k6 binary and runs it.

The build step is done using the go compiler included in the image. The partial results of the go compilation and build steps are saved to the volume in the `/cache` path (this is where the go cache and the go module cache are placed). By making this volume persistent, the time required for the build step can be significantly reduced.

The k6x docker builder (`--builder docker`) also uses this docker image. It creates a local volume called `k6x-cache` and mounts it to the `/cache` path. Thanks to this, the docker build runs almost at the same speed as the native build (apart from the first build).

## Extras

### Pragma

Version constraints can be specified using the JavaScript `"use ..."` pragma syntax for k6 and extensions. Put the following lines at the beginning of the test script:

```js
"use k6 >= v0.46"
"use k6 with k6/x/faker > 0.2"
```

The pragma syntax can also be used for output extensions:

```js
"use k6 with top >= 0.1"
```

Any number of `"use k6"` pragmas can be used.

Read the version constraints syntax in the [Version Constraints](#version-constraints) section of the [Appendix](#appendix)

> **Warning**
> Version constraints can reduce the efficiency of the cache, so it is advisable to use them only in justified cases. Even then, it is worth using permissive, upwardly open version constraints instead of specifying a specific version.

### Cache

Reusable artifacts (k6 binary, HTTP responses) are stored in the subdirectory `k6x` under the directory defined by the `XDG_CACHE_HOME` environment variable. The default of `XDG_CACHE_HOME` depends on the operating system (Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\cache`, Linux: `~/.cache`, macOS: `~/Library/Caches`)

The directory where k6x stores the compiled k6 binary can be specified in the `K6X_BIN_DIR` environment variable. If it is missing, the `.k6x` directory is used if it exists in the current working directory, otherwise the k6 binary is stored in the cache directory described above. In addition, the location of the directory used to store k6 can also be specified using the `--bin-dir` command line option. See the [Flags](#flags) section for more information.

The `version` command displays the path of the cached k6 executable after the version number.

> **Note**
> You can avoid rebuilding the k6 binary in the default k6x cache during development if you create a .k6x directory in the current working directory. In this case, k6x will automatically use this local directory to cache the k6 binary.

### Flags

The k6 subcommands are extended with some global command line flags related to building and caching the k6 binary.

- `--clean` the cached k6 binary will be deleted and a new binary will be built
- `--dry` only the cached k6 binary will be updated if necessary, the k6 command will not be executed
- `--bin-dir path` the directory specified here will be used to cache the k6 binary (it will overwrite the value of `K6X_BIN_DIR`)
  ```
  k6x run --bin-dir ./custom-k6 script.js
  ```
- `--with dependency`  you can specify additional dependencies and version constraints, the form of the `dependency` is the same as that used in the `"use k6 with"` pragma (practically the same as the string after the `use k6 with`)

  ```
  k6x run --with k6/x/mock script.js
  ```
  
- `--builder list` a comma-separated list of builders (default: `native,docker`), available builders:
  - `native` this builder uses the installed go compiler if available, otherwise the next builder is used without error
  - `docker` this builder uses Docker Engine, which can be local or remote (specified in `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable)

  ```
  k6x run --buider docker script.js
  ```

### Subcommands

Some new subcommands will also appear, which are related to building the k6 binary based on the dependencies included in the test script.

- `build` builds k6 based on the dependencies in the test script.
  ```
  Usage:
    k6x build [flags] [script]

  Flags:
    -o, --out name  output extension name
    --bin-dir path  folder for custom k6 binary (default: .)
    --builder list  comma separated list of builders (default: native,docker)
    -h, --help      display this help
  ```

- `deps` display of k6 and extension dependencies used in the test script
  ```
  Usage:
    k6x deps [flags] [script]

  Flags:
    -o, --out name  output extension name
    --json          use JSON output format
    --resolve       print resolved dependencies
    -h, --help      display this help  
  ```

### Help

The new subcommands (`build`, `deps`) display help in the usual way, with the `--help` or `-h` command line option.

The k6 subcommands (`version`, `run` etc) also display help with the `--help` or `-h` command line option, so in this case the new k6x launcher flags are displayed before the normal k6 help.

### Remote Docker

To use a remote Docker Engine, the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable must be set appropriately. To access via a TCP port, simply set the desired value in the form `tcp://host:port`. For access via SSH port, a value of the format `ssh://user@host` should be used. In this case, a properly configured ssh client that can connect without user input is also required.

## Appendix

### How It Works

*Feel free to skip this section, it is not required to use k6x.*

The test script is converted to CommonJS format with the help of the [esbuild go api](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/evanw/esbuild/pkg/api). In the resulting CommonJS source, the referenced extensions and JavaScript modules are collected using regular expressions. Local JavaScript modules are also processed recursively.

*At this point, if the k6 binary stored in the cache contains the expected extensions with the appropriate versions, the binary is simply executed with exactly the same arguments that were used to start the k6x command.*

The git repository for each extension is determined based on the [k6 extension registry](https://k6.io/docs/extensions/get-started/explore/). The k6 extension registry is accessed [directly from the GitHub repository](https://github.com/grafana/k6-docs/blob/main/src/data/doc-extensions/extensions.json) of the k6 documentation site
  using the [go-github](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/go-github/v55/github) library.

Taking into account the optional version constraints, the appropriate extension version is selected from the git tags of the extension's git repository. Currently, only GitHub repositories are supported, if required, additional repository managers can be supported (eg GitLab).

If the Go compiler is installed, the k6 binary is created using it. Otherwise the custom k6 binary is created using the [szkiba/k6x](https://hub.docker.com/r/szkiba/k6x) docker image. The Docker Engine API is accessed using the [docker go client](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/docker/docker/client), so there is no need for a docker cli command and even a remote Docker Engine can be used.

The compiled k6 binary is stored in the cache. This binary will be used as long as the extensions included in it meet the current requirements, taking into account the optional version constraints. In order to increase the efficiency of the cache, the newly built k6 binary will also include the previously used extensions (if they are still included in the registry).

At this point, the k6 binary is executed from the cache with exactly the same arguments that were used to start the k6x command.

You can read more about the development ideas in the [Feature Request](https://github.com/szkiba/k6x/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature) list.

### Limitations

- Reading the script from standard input is not supported (yet)
- Only versions in the latest 100 GitHub tags can be used in constraints


### Version Constraints

*This section is based on the [Masterminds/semver](https://github.com/Masterminds/semver) documentation.*

#### Basic Comparisons

There are two elements to the comparisons. First, a comparison string is a list
of space or comma separated AND comparisons. These are then separated by || (OR)
comparisons. For example, `">= 1.2 < 3.0.0 || >= 4.2.3"` is looking for a
comparison that's greater than or equal to 1.2 and less than 3.0.0 or is
greater than or equal to 4.2.3.

The basic comparisons are:

* `=`: equal (aliased to no operator)
* `!=`: not equal
* `>`: greater than
* `<`: less than
* `>=`: greater than or equal to
* `<=`: less than or equal to

#### Hyphen Range Comparisons

There are multiple methods to handle ranges and the first is hyphens ranges.
These look like:

* `1.2 - 1.4.5` which is equivalent to `>= 1.2 <= 1.4.5`
* `2.3.4 - 4.5` which is equivalent to `>= 2.3.4 <= 4.5`

#### Wildcards In Comparisons

The `x`, `X`, and `*` characters can be used as a wildcard character. This works
for all comparison operators. When used on the `=` operator it falls
back to the patch level comparison (see tilde below). For example,

* `1.2.x` is equivalent to `>= 1.2.0, < 1.3.0`
* `>= 1.2.x` is equivalent to `>= 1.2.0`
* `<= 2.x` is equivalent to `< 3`
* `*` is equivalent to `>= 0.0.0`

#### Tilde Range Comparisons (Patch)

The tilde (`~`) comparison operator is for patch level ranges when a minor
version is specified and major level changes when the minor number is missing.
For example,

* `~1.2.3` is equivalent to `>= 1.2.3, < 1.3.0`
* `~1` is equivalent to `>= 1, < 2`
* `~2.3` is equivalent to `>= 2.3, < 2.4`
* `~1.2.x` is equivalent to `>= 1.2.0, < 1.3.0`
* `~1.x` is equivalent to `>= 1, < 2`

#### Caret Range Comparisons (Major)

The caret (`^`) comparison operator is for major level changes once a stable
(1.0.0) release has occurred. Prior to a 1.0.0 release the minor versions acts
as the API stability level. This is useful when comparisons of API versions as a
major change is API breaking. For example,

* `^1.2.3` is equivalent to `>= 1.2.3, < 2.0.0`
* `^1.2.x` is equivalent to `>= 1.2.0, < 2.0.0`
* `^2.3` is equivalent to `>= 2.3, < 3`
* `^2.x` is equivalent to `>= 2.0.0, < 3`
* `^0.2.3` is equivalent to `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`
* `^0.2` is equivalent to `>=0.2.0 <0.3.0`
* `^0.0.3` is equivalent to `>=0.0.3 <0.0.4`
* `^0.0` is equivalent to `>=0.0.0 <0.1.0`
* `^0` is equivalent to `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0`
